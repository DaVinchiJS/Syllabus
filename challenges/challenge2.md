# Show Hide Toggle

## Step 1
Make an image and a button called Show/Hide. When you click on the button the image should disappear. When you click on the button again it should reappear.

- Hint: Check out jQuery's toggle function. 

## Step 2
Make the button name be Show when the image is hidden, and Hide when the image is shown.
