# Show & Hide an Image

## Step 1
Make an image and a button called Hide. When you click on the hide button the image should disappear.

- Hint: Check out jQuery's on function. 

## Step 2
Add a Show button. When you click on the Show button, the image should reappear.

## Step 3
Make the Show button disabled if the image is already shown, and the Hide button disabled when the image is invisible.
