# Multi-Form

## Step 1
Create a form with two radio buttons and a button named Go. Next to the radio buttons have the text Fruits and Animals.

## Step 2
Disable the button until one of the two radio buttons is selected.

- Hint: Try the 'change' event with jQuery's on function.

## Step 3
When you click on the button, replace the form with another form that has a series of checkboxes for various fruits or various animals depending on which radio button that had selected.

## Step 4
Add a button named Go to the second form. When you click on the button, replace the form with the words "You selected" and a list of the fruits or animals they selected, separated by commas.

## Step 5
When no fruits or animals are selected and the button is clicked, display the text "You did not select any " and the word "animals" or "fruits".
