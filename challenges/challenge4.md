# Login Form

## Step 1
Create a form with an Email field, a Password field and a checkbox with the text "Do you agree?".

## Step 2
Add a button named Login. When you click on the button replace the form with the words "You Win!".

- Hint: Check out jQuery's html function.

## Step 3
Only replace the form if both fields have something entered and the checkbox has been clicked.

- Hint: Check out jQuery's val function.

## Step 4
The email field must also have an email address in it.

- Hint: An email address is any string with both a @ and . in it.

## Step 5
If they click the button and a field is empty, add a small line of red text next to the field explaining what they must do.

## Step 6
Add a special background color to fields that have errors.

- Hint: trying using a class. Add the class to fields with errors.
